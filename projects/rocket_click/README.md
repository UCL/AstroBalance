## Setup

 - Install unity editor version `6000.2.10f1`
 - Download the Tobii game development API. This code was built and tested with version 9.0.4.26.
 - You need to add `.net/TobiiGameIntegrationApi.cs` `.net/Tobii.GameIntegration.Net.dll` and `lib/tobii_gameintegration_x64.dll` (I think) to your project.
