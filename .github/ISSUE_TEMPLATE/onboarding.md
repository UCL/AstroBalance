## On boarding checklist for new Astrobalance developers.

- [ ] Download the [Tobii game integration API](https://github.com/UCL-ARC/AstroBalanceDrivers). This repository is private so you will have to request access.

- [ ] Access to a Windows computer.

- [ ] Access to a Tobii eye tracker.

- [ ] Install [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/unity-hub) and Unity Editor v 6000.2.10f1. The Tobii Eye tracker will only work on Windows Machines, though it should be possible to develop parts of the application on any platform supported by Unity.

- [ ] Build and run the code using the unity editor.

- [ ] Update the onboarding documentation/template if necessary.
