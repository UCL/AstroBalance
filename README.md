## Setup

 - Install unity editor version `6000.0.63f1` (LTS)
 - Download the Tobii game development API. This code was built and tested with version 9.0.4.26.
 - You need to add `.net/Tobii.GameIntegration.Net.dll` and all the `.dll` and `.lib` files in the `lib` folder to your project.

You may need to [download the drivers](gaming.tobii.com/getstarted/) for the Tobii Eyetracker 5, and calibrate the tracker using the Tobii Experience app.
